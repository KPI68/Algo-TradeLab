## Proposed Project Topic 

Algorithm Trading utilizing more than one ticker

## Goal

* Using data sources from market historically, create two models incorporate trading algorithm, to predict daily trading actions
* Starting $10,000, take the daily trading actions for 15 days, calculate the net worth at the end
* Compare the two models, see which one is doing better
* Visualize the results and performance

## Next Steps

* Build the function to action the predicted trades and end networth
* Machine learning libraries and trade-algo application, including a new one
* Apply a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the input features (PCA), or perform feature engineering to generate new features (refer Tensorflow Playground) to train the model
