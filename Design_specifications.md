# Algorithm Trading Utilizing More Than One Ticker

* Using data sources from market historically, create two models incorporate trading algorithm, to predict daily trading actions

- Starting $10,000, take the daily trading actions for 15 days, calculate the net worth at the end

- Compare the two models, see which one is doing better

- Visualize the results and performance
